# RepoFilter
## How it works?
GitHub's API makes it nice and simple to put together a request that will return a users GitHub repositories and all of the corresponding data for each repo.

We set up an XMLHttp request to get data from the GitHub API's server.Most browsers support it and we can even update page contents without having to refresh it.

Finally we attach the received data to the DOM.
